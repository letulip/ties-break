// SCREEN G - FAMILY BUDGET. What the family earned, what it spent, and on what.
//
// THE GEOMETRY IS THE OWNER'S EXPORT, docs/design/README.md §"G. Family Budget", measured off
// docs/design/prototype/screens.dc.html: header 28/18/18 -> a three-cell summary (radius 16, 14px
// inset, hairlines between the cells, left/centre/right alignment) -> the period switcher (radius
// 11, 12.5px) -> a 202px category column with the paper artefacts laid over the space beside it,
// and the CTA pill under the list.
//
// WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM, unchanged from the screen this replaces: the ENGINE-MAINTAINED finance
// aggregate, never a scrape of `snapshot.events`. The mixed event feed is capped (60 in a snapshot,
// 400 retained) so old finance is pruned and a tournament week buries the rest under news.
// `snapshot.finance` carries category-accurate windows that survive that cap, and
// `snapshot.financialEvents` is a cap-independent slice of recent transactions for the ledger. The
// running ledger balance is still reconstructed BACKWARDS from the live `fundsCents` (the true
// current total), which stays correct for whatever slice of transactions is shown.
//
// ⚠ THREE PLACES THIS SCREEN DEPARTS FROM THE EXPORT, all three because the export is a picture of
// a game with a different engine behind it. They are decisions, not oversights:
//
//  1. THE PERIOD SWITCHER HAS TWO SEGMENTS, NOT THREE. The export offers This week / This month /
//     This year. Our engine folds finance per CATEGORY over exactly two windows (`finance.window12w`
//     and `finance.season`); the third series it carries, `finance.weekly12`, is per-week TOTALS
//     with no category breakdown at all. A "This week" tab would therefore have to scrape the
//     capped transaction feed to fill its own category list - the precise thing the paragraph above
//     says never to do. Two honest windows beat three where one is a guess.
//  2. THE DONUT IS GONE. Round-7 item 2 put a dependency-free SVG donut at the top of this screen;
//     the export's composition has no donut and no room for one, and the reading the donut carried
//     (each category's SHARE of the spend) survives on the rows themselves, where it was already
//     printed. Nothing is lost but the ring.
//  3. INCOME IS `--money-in`, NOT THE EXPORT'S `#a5db4b`. The app has one green for "money came in"
//     and it is a token; adding a second one for this screen alone would break the very principle
//     the export is written on (docs/design/README.md §3, "цвет = смысл").

/* =================================================================================================
   SCREEN G's OWN STYLES, in the SFC for the reason U0 wrote into HomeScreen: six screens are being
   built on top of that slice in parallel and `src/style.css` is the one file all six would touch.
   WHAT LEFT THIS SCREEN ENTIRELY, because a component owns it now:
     the donut and its rows  -> StatRow (src/components/ui/StatRow.vue) + see note 2 in the script
     `.option-row`/`.option-pill` -> SegmentedRow
     the panel surface       -> Card
     the CTA pill            -> PrimaryPill (variant `cta`)
   WHAT DELIBERATELY STAYED IN THE SHEET: `.physio-toggle`, `.hint`, `.ledger-week-label` and
   `.back-link` - shared vocabulary with other screens, and `.ledger-week-label` is pinned by name
   in tests/week-numbering.test.ts.

   buys that nothing and costs two real things: a ROTATED box paints outside its own rectangle (at
   2deg on a 148px note, about 3px), which is exactly the overhang that puts a 375px document into
