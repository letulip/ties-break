// THE LIFE BEAT – the week the game stops because SHE said something (the private life, wave 2).
//
// The birthday is the precedent this generalises (`world/birthday.ts`), and the two share a law:
// the ONLY way time moves again is an answer, and the engine re-validates it. What is NEW here, and
// what the birthday could never be, is that the beat is HER SPEAKING – so the dialog has no X, and
// walking away is not among the things a player can do with it.
//
// =================================================================================================
// THE FIVE RULES THIS FILE IS (wave-2 runbook §2), and where each one lives below
// =================================================================================================
//
// 1. THE BLOCK CONTRACT. `'life'` is a refusal at the top of `advanceWeeks` (`advanceRefusal`,
//    world/multiWeek.ts) AND a reason collected inside its loop – a beat may share a week with a
//    tournament, an injury or the fork, and R11-1's rule is that a week which is several things
//    reports all of them. The two halves are in world/multiWeek.ts and world.ts respectively; the
//    predicate both of them ask is `pendingLifeBeat` below.
//
// 2. ⭐ THE RECORD IS THE QUEUE. A row whose `answer` is null is waiting; several beats in one week
//    are answered one dialog at a time, in `lifeLog` order. There is deliberately no second boolean –
//    a `pending` flag beside the answer is one fact with two sources of truth, and they desync.
//
// 3. ENGINE-SIDE RE-VALIDATION (CLAUDE.md invariant 1). `answerLifeBeat` re-derives the prompt and
//    checks the option id against the list the engine itself offered, exactly as `chooseGift`
//    re-derives the birthday's four. A stale dialog cannot record an answer this beat never made.
//
// 4. ⚠⚠ THE NO-CENTS RULE. An answer is NEVER a purchase: `addEvent` is called with no
//    `amountCents`, so nothing folds into `accrueFinance` or `careerTotals` (ledger.ts gates the
//    accrual on the field being present and non-zero), and there is no price in any of its words.
//    There is no cents value anywhere in this file, which is what stops "just add a small cost"
//    being a one-line edit – it would be a schema change first.
//
// 5. `buildLifeBeatPrompt` ASSEMBLES THE COPY ENGINE-SIDE from the pools below, so the dialog
//    renders what it is handed, verbatim, and owns no sentence of its own – `buildBirthdayPrompt`'s
//    own contract, and the only shape under which her voice can be tested at all.
//
// =================================================================================================
// ⚠⚠ THE FENCE – TEMPERAMENT COLOURS THE WORDING AND NOTHING ELSE (who-she-is §3, verbatim)
// =================================================================================================
//
//   «No fork want. Her college/tour want at the fork stays on its own draw – temperament colours
//    HOW she says it, never WHAT she wants. Otherwise temperament becomes a career script.»
//
// So this file has TWO halves and the wall between them is load-bearing:
//
//   * `drawForkWant` / `forkWantWeights` take `standing`, `spirit` and `bond` and NOTHING ELSE.
//     There is no `Temperament` parameter on either of them, which is the strongest form the fence
//     can take – a temperament term cannot be added to the maths without changing a signature.
//   * `HER_LINE` is indexed BY temperament, and it is the only thing in this file that is.
//
// ⚠ AND SPIRIT IS READ, NEVER WRITTEN. Nothing in this file touches `world.spirit`: the want-draw
// reads it, the parent's answer moves `bond` alone (§4a.2's law – life moves spirit, his words move
// the standing). `applyBondDelta` is the only writer this file calls.

// `world/entries.ts` records at its own import. `endings.ts` imports THIS module (it raises the
// fork-opinion row and asks `pendingLifeBeat` before it will answer the fork), so an import back
// into `endings.ts` would close a runtime loop. `constants.ts` is the bottom of the package's graph

 *  there is no `world.partner` slot and there must never be one.
 *
 *  ⚠⚠ EPISODES RATHER THAN A SLOT IS THE 09.09 RE-CUT (review find #5), and this signature is where
 *  it is paid for. A romance that begins AND ENDS before the parent ever knew must survive save and
 *  reload intact and surface later as one honest late row; a stored «current partner» would have
 *  been overwritten out of existence the next time someone appeared. So the list keeps everything
 *  and the CURRENT one is a question asked of it, which cannot desync from the rows it reads.
 *
 *  ⚠⚠ THE TAIL DECIDES, AND IT IS A RULING (architect, 11.09) rather than a reading. The brief's
 *  prose said «the LAST row with `endedWeek === null`» while the brief's own enumerated test list
 *  said «open row then ended row -> null», and on the shape `[open, ended]` those two disagree. The
 *  builder implemented the prose; this is the reversal, on three grounds.
 *
 *  1. The divergence is UNREACHABLE. Rows are appended in calendar order and the arrival hazard
 *     refuses to draw while this is non-null (T3's eligibility), so only the TAIL can ever be open.
 *     On every state the sim can actually produce, the two readings return the same row.
 *  2. On unreachable data the tail reading FAILS SAFE and the scan fails STUCK. A row mis-ended by
 *     some future bug leaves the scan pinned non-null for the rest of the career – no arrival ever
 *     again, a permanent +5 baseline lift, and no error anywhere to say so. The tail reading lets
 *     the cooldown run and the career recover.
 *  3. Where prose and an enumerated list disagree, the list is the more specific statement.
 *
 *  ⚠ NOTHING IS LOST FROM THE RECORD EITHER WAY, which is what makes this cheap: the archive is
 *  `loveEpisodes` itself and every row stays in it. This function answers only «is someone there
 *  NOW». `pendingLifeBeat` above takes the FIRST unanswered row for the opposite and equally
 *  deliberate reason – a queue that answered its newest entry first would lose the oldest.
 *
 *  ⚠ IT READS `endedWeek` AND NEVER `knownWeek`. Whether the parent has been TOLD is a different
 *  question from whether someone is there, and conflating them would make a private girl single. */

 *      the distance BELOW spirit's baseline, so a girl at or above 70 has no such lean at all.
 *    * A CLOSE HOME pulls `tour` up – «a close one dares more». Measured off the distance ABOVE
 *      bond's start, for the same reason: 70 is the neutral reading and neutral must mean neutral.

// Written against `docs/specs/voice-bibles-2026-09.md` §A (the four bibles) and §B (the flat pool),
// and every line obeys the TWO SHAPE RULES the week-note pins already enforce for the whole corpus:
//
//   1. AT MOST ONE QUOTED SPAN PER LINE – a greedy strip over two spans swallows the narration
//      between them, so a two-span line can hide a first-person narrator from the check.
//   2. THE NARRATION OUTSIDE THE QUOTATION CONTAINS `she` – a paired strip cannot tell HER quotation
//      from anybody else's, so the `she` is what names the speaker as her.
//
// ⭐ THE COMPOSITION RULE (who-she-is §5b), and why this is 27 lines rather than 4x5x4:
//
//   temperament owns the SHAPE          – four voices, one line each per want
//   spirit owns the REGISTER            – collapsed to `low` vs not-low, which is §5b's own
//                                         «most moments only split low vs not-low»
//   bond owns the CHANNEL               – `close`/`steady` let her speak; `strained`/`cold` collapse
//                                         the four voices into ONE shared flat pool, because losing
//                                         her voice is the point

// + 3 flat, + 3 headings.

 *
 *  ⚠ THE BIBLE EACH VOICE IS WRITTEN TO, in one line each, so a later writer does not have to
 *  reconstruct it: `sunny` says the whole thing evenly and will name a feeling plainly; `fiery`
 *  gives the verdict first, at speed, in absolutes, and has not had the second thought yet; `quiet`
 *  says the practical surface and leaves herself out, so the parent reads the week off what she
 *  talked about INSTEAD; `deep` says one true thing, late, stripped of its size, in full stops.
 *
 *  ⚠ AND THE `quiet` ROWS ARE THE LICENSED EXCEPTION THE BIBLE ITSELF NAMES. §A3: «A `quiet` line
 *  that states a feeling directly is a broken line ... A tier-2 life beat in waves 2-4 may earn the
 *  exception – a feeling from her would be worth more than a paragraph from anyone else, precisely
 *  because tier 0 spent none.» This is that tier-2 beat, it fires once in a career, and even here

// swapping in a stock sad one. Lines the review's own craft already matched are kept byte-identical.
